# Fave humans! 

This is a simple SPA "Contacts App", using React, Node, & JS. The "database" is a json file that lives in the server file. Users can add their contacts through the form, and those contacts will render on a card for easy reference. The database will need to manually wiped locally and the server restarted to reset.
